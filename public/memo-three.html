                                            passing of COL (Ret.) Joseph (Joe) Anthony Piasta II of Santa Rosa,
                                            CA. He passed away on July 6, 2024, at the age of 73 following a long battle
                                            with cancer.</p>
                                        <p class="leader-style">COL (Ret.) Piasta was born on July 11,1951 in Tulsa,
                                            Oklahoma. He was the oldest of six children—John, Mary, Fran,
                                            Karen, and Polly. The family moved to Orange, California, where he excelled
                                            academically and graduated from Servite High
                                            School.</p>
                                        <p class="leader-style">COL (Ret.) Piasta was the first in his family to attend
                                            college, enrolling in the University of San Francisco (USF)
                                            where he served as student-body president, a US Army ROTC cadet, and a
                                            collegiate football athlete. He graduated with
                                            honors from both college and law school. At USF, COL (Ret.) Piasta met and
                                            fell in love with his future wife and native
                                            San Franciscan, Kathy Portman. COL (Ret.) Piasta later received a Masters of
                                            Law, graduating summa cum laude, from
                                            George Washington University.</p>
                                        <p class="leader-style">COL (Ret.) Piasta joined the Judge Advocate General’s
                                            Corps in 1976, and moved to Fort Belvoir, Virginia. He served on
                                            active duty until 1981 and developed into an outstanding trial attorney.
                                            After leaving active duty, COL (Ret.) Piasta
                                            began his career in private practice of 40-years, including 25-years as
                                            adjunct professor at USF Law School. Joe built a
                                            reputation of professionalism, integrity, and excellence across the local
                                            legal community.</p>
                                        <p class="leader-style">COL (Ret.) Piasta also served in the US Army Reserve for
                                            30-years. He mobilized to active duty in 2003 for 9-months in
                                            support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, serving as the Staff Judge Advocate for
                                            the 91st Training Division. He took great
                                            pride in training, mentoring, and inspiring the next generation of military
                                            officers, including three of his children
                                            who served in Iraq and Afghanistan and each received Bronze Star Medals. For
                                            his exemplary service, he received several
                                            recognitions including the Legion of Merit, Meritorious Service Medal, and
                                            Army Commendation Medal (with two oak leaf
                                            clusters).</p>
                                        <p class="leader-style">COL (Ret.) Piasta is survived by his beloved wife,
                                            Kathy, of 48 years; his seven children—Mary, Edward, Ann, Theresa,
                                            Frank, Joan, and John; and his nine grandchildren—Robert, Constantine,
                                            William, Joseph, Colin, Violette, Elizabeth,
                                            John, and Everett.</p>
